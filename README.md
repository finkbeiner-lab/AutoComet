# Auto Comet: Algorithm that detects, segments, and quantifies the comets in the microscopy images

This project implements a high-throughput comet assay analysis algorithm to address the low throughput and inaccuracy of the open source and commercially available tools.


# Getting Started 

The project can be either cloned or downloaded to your device from [AutoComet github](https://github.com/finkbeiner-lab/AutoComet). The code is implemented in Python 3.8 with Jupyter Notebook, and with the requirements of the following open-source libraries:

- opencv-python==4.5.3
- matplotlib==3.3.4
- numpy==1.20.1
- pandas==1.2.4
- scipy==1.6.2
- skimage==0.18.1
- Pillow==8.2.0

## Installation
You can find the Jupyter Notebook installation documentation
[on ReadTheDocs](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). For a local installation, make sure you have
[pip installed](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/) and run:

    $ pip install notebook

You may install dependencies using:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Or with the command

    $ pip install 'dependency'
    
## Usage - Running the notebook

Launch with:

    $ jupyter notebook
